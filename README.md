This is the "multi-threaded client-server application to make fun of remote Windows computers" that I wrote just out of curiosity when I was 17 years old. I was learning C++ at the time and the best way of doing that was to make pranks using a computer, so simple trojan was "the only way to go".

<b>Warning:</b> the first couple of commits would have exactly the last version of this app from 1999 with code comments in Russian and in weird Windows-1251 encoding, with some backup copies in the repository - a complete mess! I'm planning to clean it up and make it work on the latest Microsfot compilers... hang on!
